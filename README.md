# Business Analytics: Marketing and Decisions 
### 1. Bank Analytics
 Using banks.csv, run a logistic regression that models the status of a bank (strong or
weak) as a function of two to financial measures: the ratio of total loans and leases to total assets
(TotLns&Lses/Assets) and the ratio of total expenses to total assets (TotExp/Assets). Specify the
success class as weak, and use the default cutoff value of 0.5.
